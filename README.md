# Matlab_MD_trajectory_analysis

This folder contains some of the Matlab codes I have generated for analysing MD (LAMMPS) simulation trajectory data. As these codes are developed by me and not for sharing with broader audiences, these can look hard to read for others. I plan to modify these in the coming days and share them with others.
